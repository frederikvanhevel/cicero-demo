**I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

A German pharmaceutical company synthesized a class of Actinomycetia isolated from a soil sample from Dibang Valley, India, in November 2016. The Company conducts drug discovery work in Germany and France, intends to file for a patent, and plans to commercialize the medicinal product in the US, India, UK, and the EU.

We conclude that the company's activities pose a significant legal risk of non-compliance with Access and Benefit-Sharing (ABS) requirements in India (the provider country) and, consequently, with user country due diligence obligations in the EU and UK. Given the factual pattern, immediate and proactive corrective action is strongly recommended to regularize the situation.

On the provider country side, it is clear that the Indian Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and its implementing regulations apply to the Actinomycetia accessed in November 2016. The absence of Prior Informed Consent (PIC) from the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) and Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT) for benefit-sharing at the time of access, and for subsequent utilization including patenting and commercialization, constitutes a formal non-compliance. India's law also asserts extraterritorial reach over intellectual property rights and commercialization of products derived from its genetic resources, regardless of where these activities occur.

On the user country-side, EU Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 on compliance measures for users of the Nagoya Protocol is applicable to the company's drug discovery and trial activities in Germany and France. Similarly, the UK's retained ABS regulations apply to planned commercialization in the UK. Both frameworks impose due diligence obligations, requiring users to demonstrate that the genetic resource was accessed in accordance with the provider country's ABS laws. The current non-compliance with Indian law means the company cannot fulfill these due diligence requirements, which will be revealed when submitting due diligence declarations prior to seeking marketing authorization.

In short, given the significant legal, commercial, and reputational risks, we strongly recommend immediately engaging specialized Indian legal counsel to initiate a regularization process with the NBA, negotiate MAT, and ensure all patenting and commercialization activities align with Indian ABS law. Concurrently, robust internal due diligence processes must be established to address EU and UK requirements.

**II. FACT PATTERN**

We summarize the facts as we understand them:
* A German-headquartered pharmaceutical company (a for-profit private legal entity) is the entity undertaking the activities.
* The company synthesized a class of Actinomycetia isolated from a soil sample.
* The soil sample was obtained from Dibang Valley, India.
* The date of access/isolation of the Actinomycetia was November 2016.
* Drug discovery work on the Actinomycetia is conducted in Germany and France.
* The company plans to file a patent on the new compound derived from the Actinomycetia.
* Safety trials have been conducted in the EU.
* Efficacy trials will be conducted in the EU.
* The company plans to commercialize the medicinal product in the United States (US), India, the United Kingdom (UK), and the European Union (EU).
* As of the current date (2025-06-02), no specific Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) or other agreements, nor records of Prior Informed Consent (PIC) or Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT) related to the Actinomycetia from Dibang Valley, India, have been identified in the provided documentation.

**III. LEGAL ANALYSIS**

**Section 1: Provider Country Applicability Assessment (India)**

This section assesses the applicability of India's Access and Benefit-Sharing (ABS) laws, specifically the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 (the "BDA"), and the Biological Diversity Rules, 2004, as well as the more recent Biodiversity Regulations 2025.04.29, to the access and utilization of the Actinomycetia.

**1. Relevant ABS Legislation**
The primary legislation governing ABS in India is the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and the Biological Diversity Rules, 2004. These are supplemented by subsequent amendments and regulations, including the Indian Biodiversity Regulations 2025.04.29, which provide detailed provisions for benefit-sharing and compliance. India is a Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol.

**2. Personal Scope**
The German pharmaceutical company, as a foreign, for-profit private legal entity engaged in commercial utilization of a biological resource, falls squarely within the personal scope of the Indian ABS laws. Section 3(2) of the BDA explicitly requires prior approval from the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) for "any person who is not a citizen of India, or a body corporate, association or organization that is not registered in India, or a non-resident Indian" to obtain any biological resource occurring in India for research, commercial utilization, or bio-survey and bio-utilization [FN1, Section 3(2)].

**3. Material Scope**
The Actinomycetia isolated from a soil sample constitutes a "biological resource" under the BDA. Section 2(c) of the BDA defines "biological resources" broadly to include "plants, animals and micro-organisms or parts thereof, their genetic material and by-products... with actual or potential use or value" [FN1, Section 2(c)]. The company's activities involve the synthesis of a class of Actinomycetia for drug discovery, which constitutes "utilization" of this genetic resource. Furthermore, the Indian Biodiversity Regulations 2025.04.29 explicitly include "digital sequence information" (DSI) within the scope of biological resources for which prior intimation/approval and benefit-sharing obligations apply [FN2, Regulation 5(1), Form B]. If any DSI was generated or used from the Actinomycetia, it would also be covered.

**4. Temporal Scope**
The access to the soil sample occurred in November 2016. The core provisions of the BDA, including those related to access and commercial utilization (e.g., Sections 3-7, 18-47), came into force on July 1, 2004 [FN1, Section 1(2)]. As the access occurred well after these effective dates, the activities fall within the temporal scope of the Indian ABS laws. Rule 13(2) of the Indian Biodiversity Rules 2024 (which appears to be a re-numbering or update of the 2004 rules, as referenced in the research findings) further clarifies that any person in possession of a biological resource before the coming into force of the Biological Diversity (Amendment) Act, 2023, shall seek approval for research, commercial utilization, bio-survey, and bio-utilization [FN3, Rule 13(2)].

**5. Geographic Scope**
The Actinomycetia was isolated from a soil sample collected in Dibang Valley, India. The BDA extends its jurisdiction "to the whole of India" [FN1, Section 1(2)]. The definition of "access" in Section 2(a) of the Act refers to "collecting, procuring or possessing any biological resource occurring in or obtained from India" [FN1, Section 2(a)]. This clearly establishes the origin of the genetic resource within India's sovereign territory, making Indian ABS laws applicable.

**6. Functional Scope**
The company's activities, including the synthesis of Actinomycetia, drug discovery work, planned patent filing on the new compound, and commercialization of the medicinal product, all constitute "access" and "utilization" for commercial purposes under the Indian BDA. Section 2(a) of the BDA defines "access" for purposes including "research or bio-survey or commercial utilisation" [FN1, Section 2(a)]. The intent to patent and commercialize unequivocally triggers the "commercial utilisation" provisions, thereby falling within the functional scope.

**7. Conclusion on Provider Country Applicability**
Based on the comprehensive analysis of all applicable scopes, Indian ABS laws definitively apply to the access and utilization of the Actinomycetia by the German pharmaceutical company. This triggers obligations for Prior Informed Consent (PIC), Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT), and benefit-sharing.

**Section 2: User Country Applicability Assessment**

This section assesses the applicability of user country ABS compliance legislation in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), and considers implications for the United States (US).

**1. Applicability of EU Regulation (EU) No 511/2014**
The EU Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 on compliance measures for users of the Nagoya Protocol (the "EU ABS Regulation") is applicable to your company's utilization activities in Germany and France. This determination is based on the following:
* **Genetic Resource Accessed on or after 12 October 2014?** Yes, the Actinomycetia was accessed in November 2016. The EU ABS Regulation applies to genetic resources accessed on or after 12 October 2014 [FN4, Article 2].
* **Country of Access a Party to the Nagoya Protocol?** Yes, India is a Party to the Nagoya Protocol and was a Party on the date of access (October 9, 2014, ratification date) [FN5].
* **Genetic Resource Accessed within Geographic Scope of ABS Law?** Yes, the Actinomycetia was accessed in Dibang Valley, India, which is within the territorial scope of India's ABS law.
* **Party of Access has Rules on ABS that Apply?** Yes, India has comprehensive ABS legislation (BDA, Rules, Regulations) that applies to the Actinomycetia.
* **Access Relates to Non-Human Genetic Material?** Yes, Actinomycetia is a microorganism, which is non-human genetic material containing functional units of heredity [FN4, Article 3(1)]. The synthesized compound is a derivative, and the Regulation covers research and development activities on such derivatives when there is an ascertainable level of continuity with the genetic resource, which is the case here.
* **Activity Falls within Material Scope of ABS Law?** Yes, the Actinomycetia and its derivatives fall within the material scope.
* **Utilization Constitutes R&D on Genetic/Biochemical Composition Creating "New Insight"?** Yes, the "drug discovery work," "safety trials," and "efficacy trials" conducted in Germany and France constitute "utilization" as defined in Article 3(5) of the EU ABS Regulation, meaning "to conduct research and development on the genetic and/or biochemical composition of genetic resources, including through the application of biotechnology" [FN4, Article 3(5)].
* **R&D Carried Out in EU Member State?** Yes, the R&D is carried out in Germany and France, both EU Member States.

**Conclusion on EU Applicability:** The EU ABS Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 is fully applicable to your company's utilization activities in Germany and France, triggering due diligence obligations.

**2. Applicability of UK ABS Regulations**
The UK, as a Party to the Nagoya Protocol, has implemented user country due diligence obligations through its own legislation, such as The Nagoya Protocol (Compliance) Regulations 2015 (UK ABS Regulations) [FN6]. These largely mirror the EU ABS Regulation.
* **Applicability:** Given that the Actinomycetia originates from India (a Nagoya Protocol Party) and the company plans to commercialize the medicinal product in the UK, the UK's due diligence obligations will apply. This necessitates that the company demonstrates that the genetic resource was accessed in accordance with India's ABS legislation.

**3. Potential ABS Implications in the United States (US)**
The United States is not a Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) or the Nagoya Protocol. Consequently, there are no overarching federal ABS due diligence obligations in the US stemming directly from these international instruments.
* **India's Extraterritorial Claims:** However, the primary ABS implication for commercialization in the US arises from the extraterritorial application provisions of India's national ABS law. Section 6(1) of the BDA mandates that any person or entity applying for an intellectual property right "in or outside India" for any invention based on a biological resource accessed from India must obtain prior approval from the NBA *before the grant of such intellectual property rights* [FN1, Section 6(1)]. Furthermore, Section 6(1B) stipulates that prior NBA approval is required "at the time of commercialization" for IPRs obtained "in or outside India" based on Indian biological resources [FN1, Section 6(1B)]. Therefore, even though commercialization occurs in the US, India's ABS law explicitly extends its reach to such activities.

**IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS**

The company faces significant legal, commercial, and reputational risks due to the apparent non-compliance with Indian ABS law and the resulting inability to meet user country due diligence obligations in the EU and UK. A proactive and comprehensive strategy is essential.
**1. Key Legal Obligations and Risks in the Provider Country (India)**
In India, there are significant penalties for contravention of BDA provisions [FN1, Section 55]. Given the facts provided, there is a clear non-compliance as prior approval from the NBA was not sought for access, utilization, patent filing, or commercialization. This creates a risk of a challenge to the validity of any patent filed on the new compound, particularly in India, due to non-compliance with Section 6(1) of the BDA. India has also been known to actively reach out to user countries' authorities to flag non-compliance.
The Indian Biodiversity Regulations 2025.04.29 provide a framework for monetary benefit-sharing based on annual gross ex-factory sale price (excluding government taxes) [FN2, Regulation 4(1)], as follows:
* Annual turnover up to INR 5 crore: Nil
* Annual turnover above INR 5 crore to INR 50 crore (approx. EUR 550,000 to EUR 5.5 million / USD 600,000 to USD 6 million): 0.2%
* Annual turnover above INR 50 crore to INR 250 crore (approx. EUR 5.5 million to EUR 27.5 million / USD 6 million to USD 30 million): 0.4%
* Annual turnover above INR 250 crore (approx. EUR 27.5 million / USD 30 million): 0.6%
For IPR commercialization by the applicant, up to 1% of annual gross ex-factory sale price [FN2, Regulation 8(1)(i)]. If IPR is assigned/licensed, up to 5% of fees/royalties received [FN2, Regulation 8(1)(ii)]. Non-monetary benefits could include joint ownership of IP, technology transfer, capacity building, or contributions to conservation efforts [FN2, Regulation 11(1), Form F].

**2. Key Legal Risks in the User Countries (EU, UK, US)**
In our analysis, we have determined that the Indian ABS law applies to the access of the Actinomycetia in November 2016. We also concluded that EU Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 is applicable to the company's activities in France and Germany. As a result, the company has a due diligence obligation to ensure and demonstrate that the Actinomycetia was acquired in accordance with Indian ABS law. Based on the facts and documents provided, we concluded that Indian ABS law has not been complied with. As a consequence, the company currently cannot demonstrate compliance with its EU due diligence obligations. In particular, under EU law, the company will be required to submit a due diligence declaration prior to seeking a marketing authorization for the medicinal product, which will reveal the non-compliance. We recommend that the company take the following steps to resolve this non-compliance.
Possible Action: Document all efforts to regularize the situation with the Indian authorities. This documentation will be crucial for demonstrating ongoing due diligence efforts to EU and UK competent authorities.
Possible Action: Prepare to submit due diligence declarations to the competent national authorities in Germany and France (for the EU) and the UK, as the product approaches its final development stage and commercialization. These declarations will reference the ongoing or completed regularization process with India.
While the US does not have direct ABS obligations, India's extraterritorial claims mean that non-compliance with Indian law could still impact commercialization in the US, particularly concerning the underlying patent.

**3. Detailed, Actionable Steps for ABS Compliance and Risk Mitigation**

To mitigate the identified risks and achieve ABS compliance, the company should undertake the following immediate and strategic actions:

**3.1. Rectification of Non-Compliance with Indian ABS Law**
* **Objective:** To address the historical non-compliance related to the access and utilization of the Actinomycetia from India without prior approval.
* **Action:**
 * **Engage Indian Counsel:** Immediately engage specialized legal counsel in India with expertise in the Biological Diversity Act and experience in navigating the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) processes.
 * **Proactive Disclosure and Application:** Work with Indian counsel to prepare and submit a comprehensive application to the NBA for retrospective approval of access and utilization. This application should acknowledge the oversight in obtaining prior approval, detail the full scope of utilization (including drug discovery, patenting, and planned commercialization), and propose a fair and equitable benefit-sharing arrangement (MAT) that reflects the commercial value derived from the resource, potentially including a retrospective component. This proactive disclosure demonstrates good faith and a commitment to compliance.
 * **Negotiate Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT):** Be prepared for extensive negotiations with the NBA regarding the terms of benefit-sharing. This will likely involve monetary benefits (e.g., royalties, milestone payments) and non-monetary benefits (e.g., technology transfer, capacity building, joint research, access to the medicinal product in India). Explicitly address the use or generation of any Digital Sequence Information (DSI) derived from the Actinomycetia, as the new Indian regulations clearly cover DSI.
 * **Address Patent Filing:** Crucially, *before* filing any patent applications related to the new compound, the company must obtain the necessary approval from the NBA as required by Section 6 of the BDA [FN1, Section 6]. If a patent application has already been filed, the company should immediately inform the NBA as part of its disclosure and seek retrospective approval, providing a clear explanation for the oversight.

**3.2. Compliance with User Country Due Diligence Obligations (EU and UK)**
* **Objective:** To ensure full due diligence compliance under EU and UK ABS regulations for ongoing and future activities.
* **Action:**
 * **Prepare Due Diligence Declaration:** Gather all available information regarding the origin and access of the Actinomycetia. Prepare to submit a due diligence declaration to the competent national authorities in Germany and France (as user countries) at the appropriate trigger points, such as the final stage of development of the medicinal product or before applying for marketing authorization. This declaration must confirm that the genetic resource was accessed in accordance with Indian ABS law and that benefits are fairly and equitably shared. Transparency regarding the current non-compliance and the proactive steps to rectify it is crucial.
 * **Information Retention:** Maintain comprehensive records for at least 20 years after the end of the utilization period. These records must include the date and place of access, description of the genetic resource, source, PIC and MAT documentation (once obtained from India), any Internationally Recognized Certificate of Compliance (IRCC) issued by India, and any relevant permits or contractual terms [FN4, Article 4].
 * **UK ABS Regulations:** Given the planned commercialization in the UK, ensure compliance with the UK's due diligence obligations, which largely mirror those of the EU. This will involve similar record-keeping and potentially a due diligence declaration if the utilization continues within the UK.

**3.3. Establishing Robust Internal ABS Compliance Processes**
* **Objective:** To establish and update internal processes and policies to ensure ongoing ABS compliance for future R&D and commercialization activities.
* **Action:**
 * **Develop a Comprehensive ABS Compliance Policy:** Formalize an internal policy outlining the company's commitment to ABS compliance, including principles, responsibilities, and procedures. Integrate ethical frameworks, emphasizing integrity, fairness, and social responsibility in all ABS-related activities.
 * **Implement Due Diligence Procedures:** Establish clear, step-by-step procedures for conducting due diligence for all new accessions of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, regardless of origin. Define roles and responsibilities for legal, R&D, and business development teams in the due diligence process.
 * **Enhance Record-Keeping Systems:** Implement a centralized, robust record-keeping system to track all genetic resources, their derivatives, and associated information. This system should capture chain of custody documentation, details of PIC and MAT, any IRCCs, dates of access and utilization, and information on benefit-sharing payments or non-monetary contributions.
 * **Conduct Regular Training Programs:** Provide mandatory and regular training to all relevant personnel (R&D scientists, legal counsel, business development managers, procurement teams) on ABS requirements, internal policies, and due diligence procedures.
 * **Integrate ABS into Contractual Agreements:** Ensure that all future Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs), research collaboration agreements, and commercialization contracts include appropriate ABS clauses, clearly defining responsibilities for compliance and benefit-sharing.
 * **Establish an ABS Compliance Committee/Focal Point:** Designate a dedicated team or individual responsible for overseeing ABS compliance, monitoring regulatory developments, and coordinating internal efforts.
 * **Conduct Periodic Internal Audits:** Schedule regular internal audits to assess the effectiveness of ABS compliance processes, identify potential gaps, and ensure continuous improvement.

**4. Ethical Considerations**
The current situation, while a formal non-compliance, presents an opportunity for the company to demonstrate its commitment to ethical conduct and responsible business practices. Proactively engaging with the NBA, disclosing the full facts, and committing to establishing fair and equitable benefit-sharing arrangements aligns with the fundamental values of integrity, honesty, and transparency [Sub-Rule 5.01]. This approach builds trust and fosters a positive relationship with the provider country. The core tenet of ABS is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. By seeking to establish MAT, the company actively contributes to this principle, supporting the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in India and acknowledging the contributions of the communities from which the resource originated. This reflects a commitment to social responsibility. Beyond immediate legal compliance, addressing this issue proactively contributes to the company's long-term strategic sustainability. It mitigates significant reputational risks, enhances stakeholder confidence, and ensures a more secure and ethically sound operating environment for future biodiversity-related research and development. Choosing the path that is legally sound, socially responsible, and strategically sustainable is paramount [Sub-Rule 5.05].
